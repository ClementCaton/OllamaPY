# OllamaPY

OllamaPY is a Python library I did to use the Ollama API for my own projects. Feedback is appreciated.<br>
It's a simple interface, nothing fancy.

## Documentation
I will take the time to write a proper documentation later, but for now, you can check the ollama API documentation [Here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## Installation
Copy paste the ollama.py file in your project and import it.<br>
(don't forget to star the repo if you like it, maybe one day it'll have pip support)
