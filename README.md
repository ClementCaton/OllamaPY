# OllamaPY

OllamaPY is a Python library I did to use the Ollama API for my own projects. Feedback is appreciated.
It's a simple interface, nothing fancy.

## Documentation

## Installation
Copy paste the ollama.py file in your project and import it.<br>
(don't forget to star the repo if you like it, maybe one day it'll have pip support)
